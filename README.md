I have you as collaborators to this repository. 
To clone the it to your PC, go to your command line and run 
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CodeBench-Backend

Replace the `your-username` with your own.

When adding something to the code, you will create a new branch and do all your work in that branch.
You can create a new branch by running `git branch new-branch-name`. For example,
```
git branch login-page-branch
```
To move to the new branch, run 
```
git checkout new-branch-name
```
You can check which branch you are on with `git branch`

Do all your work in the new branch and keep commiting your changes.

To upload your new branch to this remote repository run,
``` 
git push origin new-branch-name
```
Push only to the branch that you created. Don't push to the `master` branch.

Whenever updating your branch with other's changes in the branch, run 
```
git pull origin branch-name
```
